* "*On the Real-World Adversarial Robustness of Real-Time Semantic Segmentation Models for Autonomous Driving" by Giulio Rossolini, Federico Nesti, Gianluca D'Amico, Saasha Nair, Alessandro Biondi, and Giorgio Buttazzo - (Extended journal version) - [pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06179)


In these papers we extensively explore the robustness of real-time Semantic Segmentation models against adversarial patches in the context of autonomous driving. We perform experiments both on Cityscapes and on datasets collected with the CARLA simulator.
We propose a novel loss function that improves attack performance. We also propose the scene-specific attack, a novel attack methodology that exploits geometrical information from the simulator to apply accurately re-projected patches onto a known, fixed attackable surface (i.e., a billboard). We found that this attack outperforms the standard Expectation-Over-Transformation attack methodology.

The networks under tests proved to be somehow robust to these kinds of attacks, hence raising interesting questions not only about the actual real-world adversarial attack effect, but also on the intrinsic robustness of semantic segmentation models.

## Code
The code is out now!
The Semantic Segmentation utilities are from https://github.com/meetps/pytorch-semseg.

#### Setup
This code was tested in a virtual environment with Python3.6, on a GPU cluster that supported CUDA>=11.1. 
You might want to check the installation requirements of your machine before proceeding.
```
pip install -r requirements-gpu1.txt
```

#### Datasets
The datasets used for this paper were:
* Cityscapes, that you can download from here: https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/
* A few custom CARLA datasets, that we can release upon request.

#### Models
Two versions of each network were used for the experiments: the pre-trained version and the fine-tuned version on CARLA. 
The pretrained versions can be found at:
- https://github.com/ycszen/TorchSeg (BiseNet)
- https://github.com/ydhongHIT/DDRNet (DDRNet)
- https://github.com/hszhao/ICNet (ICNet)

The CARLA fine-tuned versions can be provided upon request.

#### Config files
To perform attacks, a config.yml file is required. Adapt each network's template to your own weights and dataset paths.
Also, make sure that the path in the field adv_patch/optimization/loss/NPS/argument points to a .txt listing of the printable colors (RGB tuples).
You can change the optimization/loss parameters, the patch parameters, and the path to save the experiments results.

#### Launch the attacks!
Two different attacks are provided: the EOT-based attack (untargeted_patch_attack.py) that can be performed on both Cityscapes and CARLA datasets, and the scene-specific attack, that can only be performed on CARLA datasets.
```
python untargeted_patch_attack.py --config configs/config.yml
python specific_patch_attack.py --config configs/config.yml
```
